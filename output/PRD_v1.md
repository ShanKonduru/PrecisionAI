# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The proposed application is a web-based survey creation and management platform designed to enable businesses and individuals to efficiently gather feedback, conduct research, and collect data through customizable surveys. By providing a straightforward and intuitive interface, the application addresses the need for a user-friendly tool that simplifies the process of survey creation, distribution, and analysis. The system integrates a front-end built with Streamlit, a Flask-based middleware, and a PostgreSQL backend to deliver a seamless user experience and robust data handling capabilities.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

**Business Goals:**
- Establish a scalable and secure platform for survey creation and management.
- Enable rapid deployment to cater to initial user demand and facilitate future growth.
- Provide businesses and individuals with a cost-effective solution for data collection.

**User Goals:**
- Allow users to easily create, manage, and distribute surveys.
- Provide real-time analytics and visualization of survey results.
- Ensure secure and efficient data handling for both survey creators and respondents.

## 3. User Stories/Personas

### User Roles:
1. **Survey Creator:** Typically a business professional or researcher looking to gather data.
2. **Survey Respondent:** Individuals providing feedback or data via surveys.

### User Stories:
1. As a **Survey Creator**, I want to register and log in so that I can manage my surveys securely.
2. As a **Survey Creator**, I want to create a new survey with a variety of question types so that I can tailor it to my specific data collection needs.
3. As a **Survey Creator**, I want to share a link to my survey so that respondents can easily access and complete it.
4. As a **Survey Creator**, I want to view real-time analytics of survey responses so that I can quickly interpret the data.
5. As a **Survey Respondent**, I want to access the survey via a link without needing to log in so that I can provide my feedback easily.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### Front End Features:
- **User Registration/Login:** Forms for creating an account and logging in, including password reset functionality.
- **Dashboard:** An interface for managing surveys, viewing statistics, and accessing user settings.
- **Survey Creation Interface:** A tool for defining survey titles, descriptions, and adding questions of various types (multiple choice, open-ended text, rating scales).
- **Survey Management:** Features to view, edit, activate, deactivate, and delete surveys.
- **Survey Sharing:** Generate and manage shareable links for survey distribution.
- **Response Visualization:** Display survey responses using charts and graphs, updated in real time.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure usability across desktop and mobile devices.

### Middleware Services:
- **User Authentication API:** Endpoints for registration, login, logout, and token management.
- **Survey APIs:** CRUD operations for surveys, questions, and options.
- **Response API:** Submit and manage survey responses from unauthenticated users.
- **Data Validation:** Ensure incoming data is sanitized and validated.
- **Rate Limiting:** Protect against abuse of public endpoints (e.g., response submission).
- **Session Management:** Secure handling of user sessions and authentication tokens.

### Backend Capabilities:
- **Database Schema:** PostgreSQL tables for users, surveys, questions, responses, and answers.
- **Authentication Logic:** Password hashing and verification for user accounts.
- **Data Storage/Retrieval:** Efficient mechanisms for storing and querying survey data and responses.
- **Data Aggregation:** Logic for processing survey results for real-time analytics.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure relational consistency within the database.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Support hundreds of concurrent users with optimized query handling.
- **Security:** Implement basic security measures, including password hashing and input validation.
- **Scalability:** Design architecture to allow future scaling, including cloud deployment considerations.
- **Usability:** Intuitive interface design for ease of use across all user roles.
- **Reliability:** Ensure the system is stable and able to recover from potential failures.

## 6. Scope & Exclusions

**In Scope:**
- Basic survey creation and management features.
- Real-time response visualization for survey creators.
- User authentication system for survey creators.
- Initial deployment supporting hundreds of concurrent users.

**Out of Scope:**
- Advanced analytics and reporting features (e.g., cross-tabulation).
- Integration with third-party services (e.g., social media, CRM systems).
- Mobile applications (native iOS/Android apps).

## 7. Assumptions & Constraints

**Assumptions:**
- Users have basic internet access and a web browser.
- Initial user base will primarily consist of small to medium businesses.

**Constraints:**
- Limited initial budget for development and deployment.
- Dependence on cloud service provider capabilities and limitations.

## 8. Future Considerations/Phases (Optional)

- **Advanced Analytics:** Incorporate more sophisticated data analysis tools and reporting features.
- **Third-party Integrations:** Enable connectivity with external systems for data import/export.
- **Mobile Applications:** Develop native apps for enhanced mobile user experience.
- **Scalability Enhancements:** Further optimize infrastructure to support thousands of concurrent users. 

This Product Requirements Document outlines a clear vision and roadmap for the development of the survey application, ensuring all stakeholders are aligned on the goals and functionalities of the system.
