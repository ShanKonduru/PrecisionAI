    A web application built with Streamlit.
    Key features include:
    - User registration and login forms.
    - Dashboard for authenticated users to create new surveys.
    - Survey creation interface: allowing users to define survey title, description, and add various question types (e.g., multiple choice, open-ended text, rating scales).
    - Survey management: view, edit, activate, deactivate, and delete surveys.
    - Shareable survey links for respondents.
    - Real-time display of survey responses (charts/graphs) for survey creators.
    - Responsive design for desktop and mobile access.

    A Flask REST API acting as the central communication layer.
    Key functionalities include:
    - User authentication endpoints (register, login, logout, token management).
    - API endpoints for survey creation, retrieval, update, and deletion (CRUD).
    - API endpoints for managing survey questions and options.
    - API endpoints for collecting survey responses from unauthenticated users.
    - Data validation and sanitization for all incoming requests.
    - Rate limiting for public-facing response submission.
    - Secure handling of user sessions and authentication tokens.

    - Responses (response ID, survey ID, respondent ID/IP, submission timestamp).
    - Answers (answer ID, response ID, question ID, answer value).
    Backend logic for:

    **Target Audience:** Businesses and individuals needing to quickly create and distribute surveys for feedback, research, or data collection.
    **Authentication:** Simple username and password authentication for survey creators. Respondents will not require authentication.
    **Scalability:** Initial focus on supporting hundreds of concurrent users; future scaling considerations will be addressed in subsequent phases.
    **Security:** Basic security measures including password hashing, input validation, and protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
    **Deployment:** Intended for cloud deployment (e.g., Docker containers on AWS ECS or similar).
